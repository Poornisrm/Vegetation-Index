# Vegetation-Index
This repository presents RL-VI, a reinforcement learning-based framework that dynamically formulates vegetation indices optimized for rice crop stress detection. It integrates Sentinel-2 multispectral and smartphone RGB imagery to enable early, accurate, and scalable stress monitoring for precision agriculture.
